## Description

This is an application that uses NoSQL. NoSQL stands for "not only SQL(Structured Query Language)" and is a database management system that differs from SQL. They are designed to handle large-scare and sometimes unstructured data. NoSQL uses different models, routes, and controllers to allow for scaling. There is no schema that eliminates specific data modeling. 

This app is made for use by a large numbers of users. A user has a profile and can create a friends list consisting of other users. Users can have their thoughts posted and other users can react to them. You can update users, thoughts, and even reactions! Everything can also be deleted!
